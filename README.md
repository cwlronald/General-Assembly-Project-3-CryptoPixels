# CryptoPixels

## Introduction

Link to website: https://cryptopixels.herokuapp.com/

The first group project and the third one during the course with General Assembly. The initial idea was that a user would accumulate points by visiting partnered restaurants/attractions and use these points to buy and sell these Pixel NFTs on a marketplace. Unfortunately we only managed to build the marketplace. But it was very well done to say the least. This website is even optimized for mobile.

This project was done in a group of three, one member foucsed on the frontend (and she's really really good at it.), another on the user login and authentication and I built everything else, mainly the data modeling, api routes and structuring out the front end.

## Code breakdown
Node + React + Mongo. Code consists of the marketplace, individual item details, user profile. All of which the user is able to edit.


## Biggest challenges (descending order)
### Overall
It was interesting to work as a group as coding always felt like such an individualistic thing. But I would say that my group managed to pull off what we had set ourselves out to do. Overall I was quite comfortable using node as a back end. Surprisingly, Mongo as a nosql database was alot easier than I had expected (since I come from an SQL background)


## Post Mortem
# Approach and Process
- What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
  I would probably have chose a more complicated project that did not require me to use authentication. I completed the base app within about two days with the help of google and youtube (basically google)

- What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
  Sticking to my philosophy of making simple things that work. Any person checking out my portfolio would not bother spending too much time to figure out how each of my apps work or fiddle with it (yes im talking about you). I was quite disheartened when I saw that some of my coursemates were not able to finish what they intended as their products were too complicated for the current knowledge we had
